This software is developed with the goal of supporting science applications for
the NASA ICESat-2 mission. This work was initially supported by an appointment to
the NASA Postdoctoral Program at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, administered
by Universities Space Research Association under contract with NASA. This work
is developed in conjunction with other ICESat-2 projects.
